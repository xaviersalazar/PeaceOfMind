            A versatile tool thats primarily used to introduce water-soluble

            have used it for 50 years to refresh and energize the skin. It also

            <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Disincrustation</span>: The
            galvanic current creates a chemical reaction that softens or
            emulsifies (liquefies) sebum, turning it into soap (a process known
            as saponification). Soap is made of fat and lye (sodium hydroxide).
            After liquefying the sebum, the electrical current form the galvanic
            unit interacts with the salts (sodium chloride) in the skin,
            creating the chemical sodium hydroxide or lye. The lye and fatty
            liquefied sebum combine to form a soapy substance that helps
            dissolve grease deposits, debris, and blackheads in the hair
            follicles, making comedones much easier to extract. A deep pore
            cleansing, and a particularly beneficial for acne or oily skin.
            Disincrustation means the introduction of ions that assist the
            penetration of the water-soluble product into the skin. Those 2
            types are Cataphoresis and Anaphoresis.
