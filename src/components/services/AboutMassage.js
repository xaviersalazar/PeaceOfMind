                  We all have stress, tension, aches and pains that we
                  experience and need to give attention to, in order to take
                  care of our bodies, we only get one body. Everyone experiences
                  stress from everyday living, we feel tension laced throughout
                  or muscles sometimes accompanied by aches and pain from old
                  accidents, medical conditions, and repetitive hard work we put
                  our bodies thought daily. No matter what your occupation is
                  working too long without a break creates tension in your back,
                  shoulders, and neck muscles, tired eyes , and slower,more
                  easily irritated mental process.

                  Human touch increases the production of endorphins, growth
                  hormone, along with DHEA, all of which lengthen your life span
                  and lower the negative impact of stress. Studies have found
                  that patients who are regularly touched recover faster than
                  those who are not touched. So get a massage and feel your mood
                  improve.

                  combined in to your massage cream or oils, and other healing
                  earth products.
